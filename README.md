## Tech Stack Overview
This portfolio app was built using React.js, with HTML5 and CSS3 (leveraging Flexbox and Grid) to create a clean, responsive design. It features a custom click animation, an engaging word randomizer effect on load, and smooth scrolling with anchor-based jump navigation between sections. The site includes form submission functionality, image scrollers, and is fully responsive across all screen sizes. The project was bootstrapped with Create React App and deployed via GitHub Pages.
